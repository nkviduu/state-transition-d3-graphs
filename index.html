For example in financial advice recomendation would usually have recomendation of new financial resource allocations. Decisions on how to proceed would be aided by understanding required transaction scale in context of current and recommended allocations. Following set of graphs would assist in this type of assesment. Given sample set of asset class re-allocation recommendation in this demo should provide idea of effectiveness of this approach. Demo data is editable allowing to apply different sets of data. </p> <p> Graphs are implemented using popular low level D3 library to form basis for fine grain control of specifc implementation needs. The required fine grain control is something that may not be available in quicker and easier to implement higher abstraction level library such as HighCharts or C3. </p> <p> In following example D3 implementated graph components are wrapped in React component interface for easier re usability. Graphs are implemented with ability to wrap them as well in Angular or View components or using directly in Javascript. </p> </div> </div> <div class="graphs"></div> </main> <script src="src.e0b5558f.js"></script> </body></html>
