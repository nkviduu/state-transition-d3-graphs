For example, financial advice typically would present recommendation of new financial resource allocations. Decisions on how to proceed can be aided by clear understanding of required transaction scale in context of current and recommended allocations. </p> <p> The following set of graphs would assist in this type of assessment. Given sample set of asset class re-allocation recommendation in this demo should provide idea of effectiveness of this approach. Demo data is editable allowing to apply different sets of data. </p> <p> Graphs are implemented using relatively low-level abstraction library - D3, to form basis for fine grain control of specific implementation needs. The required fine grain control is something that may not be available in quicker and easier to implement higher abstraction level library such as Highcharts or C3. </p> <p> In following example D3 implementated graph components are wrapped in React component interface for easier re usability. Graphs are implemented with ability to wrap them as well in Angular or View components or using directly in Javascript. </p> </div> </div> <div class="graphs"></div> </main> <script src="src.e21cd0f9.js"></script> </body></html>
